Some notes about the organization of the workshop.

# Technical issues

## What we would like to have

- support enough participants
- have a fancy enough chat
- live streaming to Youtube (or at least archiving)

## Conference

- We could use [BigBlueButton](https://bigbluebutton.org/), the de facto
  standard open-source solution which scales well (as long as there are not too
  many open cameras) and has a reasonable interface. There are servers which we
  should have access to. Cons: there no easy way to redirect the stream to
  Youtube.

## Socializing

- [gather.town](https://gather.town/) is really cool to have "real-life like"
  discussions (you walk in a small world and discuss only with people around),
  the free version is limited to 25 participants, which works very well
- [Calla chat](https://www.calla.chat/) is an
  [open-source](https://github.com/capnmidnight/Calla) variant of the above, to
  be tried out
- [Mozilla hubs](https://hubs.mozilla.com/) is the same but in 3D (a bit too
  fancy, maybe).
  
## Website

- [MiniConf](https://github.com/Mini-Conf/Mini-Conf) is a tool to run a
  conference. It takes care of displaying the schedule, etc. Might be an
  overkill for us.
