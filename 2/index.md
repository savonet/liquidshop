Abstracts
---------

**Romain Beauxis: _Some news about Liquidsoap_** / [slides](slides/1.liquidsoap.pdf)

**Buster Neece: _[AzuraCast](https://www.azuracast.com/), Liquidsoap, and the Open Radio Ecosystem_** / [slides](slides/2.azuracast.pdf)

Five years ago, a fan radio station project expanded its focus from a single
community to being a free and open-source web radio suite for the whole web
radio community. AzuraCast was born, and since then it has seen remarkable
growth in the community, with tens of thousands of stations using it today. From
the very start, under the hood of AzuraCast was Liquidsoap, which opened up a
world of "power user" customization for users. Maintaining a fully free and
open-source web radio option has been a labor of love, filled with lots of great
moments, but also lots of challenges, so join us as we talk about how things
have gone so far, and what's next for us.

**Mark Jeghers: _[Playgen](https://github.com/jeghers/playgen): an automated
playlist generator_** / [slides](slides/3.playgen.pdf)

Playgen provides automated playlist generation with enhanced randomization,
management APIs, on-demand request queueing and history logging. This talk
presents the basic design and usage details that a software developer needs to
get started.

**Rich Showalter and Gene Savage: [Live365](https://live365.com/) Product Showcase**

Live365 is a pioneer in streaming audio with its first streams going live
in 1998. In 2017 Live365 relaunched on a new platform powered by
Liquidsoap. Boasting over 4,000 active broadcasters, Live365 provides a
one-stop-shop for streaming audio by offering music licensing (US, UK and
Canada), cloud/live management tools, ad insertion with revenue share, analytics
and a full directory with mobile, Alexa and iHeart distribution.

**Chris Mahoney and Rob Carballo: _MediaMesh: Utilizing Liquidsoap to Help Steer the Future of Communication_**

TrueMotive is a close-knit team with a deep shared background in the evolution
of audiovisual and emerging technologies, who during this global pandemic have
had a lot of time to consider the future of human communication and
interaction. Our team is committed to being a strong voice for a future that
returns individual creative control, and natural human interaction that the
evolution of Web 2.0 platforming has failed to provide.

Liquidsoap has been pivotal in achieving our vision for a media system that
allows users to collaborate and iterate on streaming and classic prerecorded
media content. Having evolved through the web broadcasting influx of the past 2
decades, technology is converging in such a way that integrates existing
streaming approaches with truly novel interactive media production/sharing.

Our talk will cover the journey toward a v1.0 release, our goals for the system
in terms of novel user experience, and some lessons learned along the way. A
short demo of the user interface is also in order with our user experience lead
Rob Carballo, to review how modern web technologies can make MediaMesh possible
while also shifting power from monolithic platforms to individuals & close-knit
communities.

**Antonia Folguera and Pedro Vílchez: _[xrcb.cat](https://xrcb.cat/) -- Barcelona Community Radio Networkx_** / [slides](slides/6.xrcb.cat.pdf)

**Peter Bokor: _Liquidsoap and the [Lahmacun community radio](https://www.lahmacun.hu/)_** / [slides](slides/7.lahmacun.pdf)

The talk presents how Liquidsoap is used in the Lahmacun community web radio
(based in Budapest, Hungary). Lahmacun radio was founded in 2018, early versions
of the website had used Liquidsoap as part of an Azuracast instance (using the
functionalities offered by Azuracast), then we introduced a custom Liquidsoap
script (entirely detached from Azuracast's scheduling features). Our current
efforts aim at upgrading our Liquidsoap 1.4 script to a recent 2.0
version. Highlights of our script include advanced usages of the delay operator
and how we use fading transitions. Lahmacun radio's regular IT team consists of
5+ volunteers (all of them being experienced IT professionals).

**Sheri	Barclay: _[KPISS](https://kpiss.fm/) 2.0 One year on -- a talk about sustainability_** / [slides](slides/8.kpiss.pdf)

I would like to discuss the finer points of building and sustaining a community
pre, during and post pandemic as well as how we updated the structure of our
website in a year since the last liquid soap meeting, the potential to build in
the metaverse and some thoughts on growth and an interesting new player to the
streaming game.

**Gilles Pietri: _Migrating from 1.4 to 2.0_**

Some insight about the things that needed to change to work on 2.0, and the
improvement made possible through the new API / language possibilities
(including FFmpeg frame copy).
