Hi everybody,

We are glad to announce the second edition of *Liquidshop*, the Liquidsoap
workshop, which will be held online on

    ** January 23rd 2022 **
    
To goal is to gather all people interested in Liquidsoap (of course) but also in
related topics

- audio and video streaming
- radio broadcasting
- signal processing
- audio and video synthesis
- and so on

using whichever software. This is thus the place to share to the world your
favorite or cutting edge technologies and projects!

We will have 3 different tracks for the event, namely

- showcases: short presentations about a website / radio / art installation that
  you built using Liquidsoap or other related tools
- tech talks: in-depth presentation of a technology related to Liquidsoap and
  streaming in general
- workshops: user-centered freeform discussions about your project or issues
  around Liquidsoap and streaming
    
If you're interested to participate, whether it is as an attendee or a
presenter, make sure to register via our website at
http://www.liquidsoap.info/liquidshop/ or directly via the form available at
https://forms.gle/EDFsfMCS4dNKnrxc9

We are super excited for this event. We have already secured a couple of
interesting speakers and we would love to get to know the community better, see
what y'all are doing with liquidsoap and other releated projects, community
radios, live video, weird installations, etc. and meet with everyone.

Finally, if any of you have some specific topics to discuss and would like to
learn more about Liquidsoap, this will be a great place to connect!

See y'all soon!
