Hi everybody,

We are glad to announce the third edition of *Liquidshop*, the Liquidsoap
workshop, which will be held online on

    ** Thursday 30 May 2023 **
    
To goal is to gather all people interested in Liquidsoap (of course) and welcome any contribution, related or not to liquidsoap.

We are particularly eager to get to know how people in the community do radio, media streaming and more,
learning about specific tools or workflow that we could, in turn, use to enhance how liquidsoap works.

We also love to meet the people involved and engaged with these technologies, community radios, non-profit but also budding startups
or more established businesses, art project and installations and more!

- audio and video streaming
- radio broadcasting
- signal processing
- audio and video synthesis
- community projects
- creative art and art installations
- and so on

using whichever software. This is thus the place to share to the world your
favorite or cutting edge technologies and projects!

We will have 3 different tracks for the event, namely

- showcases: short presentations about a website / radio / art installation that
  you built using Liquidsoap or other related tools
- tech talks: in-depth presentation of a technology related to Liquidsoap and
  streaming in general
- workshops: user-centered freeform discussions about your project or issues
  around Liquidsoap and streaming
    
If you're interested to participate, whether it is as an attendee or a
presenter, make sure to register via our website at
http://www.liquidsoap.info/liquidshop/ or directly via the form available at
https://forms.gle/2QZDNJUH9XdRJ5bP8

We are super excited for this event. We have already secured a couple of
interesting speakers and we would love to get to know the community better, see
what y'all are doing with liquidsoap and other releated projects, community
radios, live video, weird installations, etc. and meet with everyone.

Finally, if any of you have some specific topics to discuss and would like to
learn more about Liquidsoap, this will be a great place to connect!

See y'all soon!
