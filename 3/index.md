The **liquidshop 3** is the third edition of a workshop about
[Liquidsoap](https://www.liquidsoap.info/) and related technologies.  The goal is
to gather all people interested in Liquidsoap (of course) and welcome any
contribution, related or not to Liquidsoap.

We are particularly eager to get to know how people in the community do radio,
media streaming and more, learning about specific tools or workflow that we
could, in turn, use to enhance how liquidsoap works. We also love to meet the
people involved and engaged with these technologies, community radios,
non-profit but also budding startups or more established businesses, art project
and installations and more!

Topics of interest are for instance

- audio and video streaming
- radio broadcasting
- signal processing
- audio and video synthesis
- website interaction
- community projects
- creative art and art installations
- and so on

This is thus the place to share to the world your favorite or cutting edge
technologies and projects!

It will be held on **Tuesday 30 May 2023**. Feel free to
[register](https://forms.gle/2QZDNJUH9XdRJ5bP8) in order to attend or propose a
talk!

Presenting the new features of Liquidsoap.

**Youenn Piolet: _Building an open source production ready liquidsoap stack for
radio broadcasting using cloud native tools_** / [slides](slides/rf.pdf)

The ins an outs of building a portable liquidsoap stack for resilient radio live
streaming, with production ready open source monitoring tools: docker,
prometheus, grafana, alertmanager, nginx, icecast. In this presentation we will
share our liquidsoap scripts and a cloud native monitoring stack similar to what
we use at [Radio France](https://www.radiofrance.fr/) to stream and monitor our
70 online radios.

**Alejandro Ferrari: _IoT based Broadcast radio capture_** / [slides](slides/mediainbox.pdf)

We'll share some lesson learned trying to build a remote managed IoT Broadcast
capture and recording under bad internet.

A brief discussion of our community and workflow.

**Peter	Bokor: _Scheduling dynamic length radio shows in fixed time slots_** / [slides](slides/lahmacun.pdf)

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FaPPfjhTfns" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

[Lahmacun radio](https://lahmacun.hu/) is a happy Liquidsoap user since many
years now. We use a custom Liquidsoap configuration inside an Azuracast
instance. Our basic use case is fixed time slots for shows in a weekly
rotation. One challenge we face is that the exact length of each show is a
priori unknown. For example, a show on Tuesday between 6-7PM may be 55 or 70
minutes and the Liquidsoap configuration needs to handle it in a flexible
manner. The expected semantics we'd like to implement is that too short episodes
will not be played again in the slot (an ambient playlist will be played
instead) and too long episodes will be faded out at the end of the slot. Also,
shows need to start on time, which means that other playbacks may need to be
interrupted. We at Lahmacun radio have been experimenting with different ways of
implementing the previous semantics, which are: 1) scheduled switch + once
operator + external daily reloads (currently in production), 2) scheduled
switch + delay operator (in development).  In this talk/workshop, we'd like to
discuss our main use case with other users and improve on our solution if
necessary/possible.

**Martin Kirchgessner: _Making your app interact with Liquidsoap_** / [slides](slides/showergel.pdf)

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_STnqvCSzlU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

For the past 3 years I've been developing
[Showergel](https://showergel.readthedocs.io), a light web application acting as
a front-end to a Liquisoap script. It was designed to be plugged with any
Liquidsoap script: that was too ambitious, but at least I've learned a few
things along the way! In this talk, I will share some insights and advices to
fellow developers trying to interact with a running Liquidsoap script.

**Mircea Paun: _Which next song would be the best?_**

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_9fi_Foa1DI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Playlist Scheduler, playlist import custom settings, automatic create playlist
from a playlist file.

I want to help to improve music playlist scheduling songs: artist and title
separation / Song properties separation like: tempo, mood, public top scoring, personal scoring... / "same hour separation" / title & artist & song (hours) prev. day / number of plays in other hours till play again in same hour / "max. waiting" then force to schedule (days) / "percent back" in a scheduler (per individual song or per tag/properties) / priority/order of scheduling (per category or group/tag/properties), I mean which one will be choosing first then second and so on, when engine search for the right song.  Day restrictions (will override the others separation rules): Song or Artist or Title max per day
